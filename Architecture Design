 Architecture Design

The system architecture consists of the following components:
1. Android Application
2. Backend Server
3. Robot with Integrated Sensors
4. Communication Protocol

    - Companion Chat Interface
}

RECTANGLE BackendServer {
    - Node.js
    - Express.js
    - MongoDB
    - REST API
    - Data Storage
}

RECTANGLE Robot {

    - MQTT Protocol
    - Emergency Detection
    - Health Data Transmission
}

RECTANGLE CommunicationProtocol {
    - MQTT for real-time communication
    - REST API for backend interaction
}

=== Database Schema

The MongoDB database will include the following collections:

==== Users
|===
| Field          | Type     | Description
| ---            | ---      | ---
| user_id        | ObjectId | Unique identifier for each user
| name           | String   | Name of the user
| age            | Number   | Age of the user
| medical_history| Array    | List of medical conditions
| medication_schedule | Array | List of medications with timings
|===

==== HealthMetrics
|===
| Field          | Type     | Description
| ---            | ---      | ---
| metric_id      | ObjectId | Unique identifier for each metric
| user_id        | ObjectId | Reference to Users collection
| timestamp      | Date     | Date and time of the metric recording
| heart_rate     | Number   | Heart rate value
| blood_pressure | String   | Blood pressure reading
|===

==== EmergencyAlerts
|===
| Field          | Type     | Description
| ---            | ---      | ---
| alert_id       | ObjectId | Unique identifier for each alert
| user_id        | ObjectId | Reference to Users collection
| timestamp      | Date     | Date and time of the alert
| alert_type     | String   | Type of alert (e.g., fall detected, abnormal health reading)
| status         | String   | Status of the alert (e.g., pending, resolved)
|===

=== Algorithms

The following algorithms will be implemented:

==== Health Monitoring
1. Continuous data collection from sensors.
2. Threshold-based alerts for abnormal readings.
3. Historical data analysis for trend detection.

==== Medication Management
1. Schedule-based push notifications.
2. User confirmation prompts for medication intake.

==== Emergency Detection
1. Real-time analysis of sensor data.
2. Immediate alert generation for critical conditions.
3. Automated notifications to caregivers.

==== Companion Chat
1. Natural Language Processing (NLP) for conversation.
2. Personalized responses based on user preferences and history.
3. Multi-language support using pre-trained language models.

=== Communication Protocol

The MQTT protocol will be used for real-time communication between the robot and the mobile application. The REST API will be used for backend interactions to fetch and store data.

1. MQTT:
   * Lightweight messaging protocol ideal for IoT devices.
   * Ensures real-time communication for health monitoring and emergency alerts.

2. REST API:
   * Provides endpoints for data access and management.
   * Ensures secure and scalable interactions between the mobile app and the backend server.
